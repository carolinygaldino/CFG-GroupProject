								<h1>Take inventory of your life</h1>
								<p>Write down the eight dimensions and put your life under a microscope. Where are you excelling? What activities are already in place that you want to continue? Now move into the areas you would like to improve. Are you working too much? Do you find the number of your meaningful relationships dwindling? More generally, where are you currently unhappy –– and what do you think is lying at the root of that unhappiness? .</p>

								<h1>Set S.M.A.R.T. goals.</h1>
								<p>Any goal should be specific, measurable, achievable, realistic, and timely. By creating parameters around your goals and making sure each is attainable, you’ll have a better chance at meeting them. 

									Begin with your larger goals and then set smaller, short-term goals that ladder back to your big ones. As you plan and begin to execute on your goals, it’s important to remember how critical patience is. You’re beginning a journey. There will be bumps in the road and twists and turns along the way. This is what comes with personal evolution. Don’t let it discourage or derail your plans.</p>

								<h1>Track your progress.</h1>
								<p>Once you’ve taken inventory and set some goals, the real work begins. That’s why you need a plan and routines that help you track your progress. There are numerous ways you can do this. Find a spouse, significant other, or friend who can serve as an accountability partner. </p>

								<h1>Update your wellness plans regularly.</h1>
								<p>Pure wellness is always evolving. Unfortunately, there is no endpoint where you can just coast and call it good. But that’s the amazing, wonderful thing about the journey. The more we change and grow, the more opportunities for growth we uncover. Sometimes our old goals give way to new goals. And sometimes we realize that our goals take more time than we originally anticipated. That’s ok.</p>
