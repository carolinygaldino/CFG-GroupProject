During the Web development course in Code first girl, a group project was undertaken where HTML, CSS and JavaScript were used to create a website. The objective of the project was to learn how to work effectively as a team while simultaneously becoming proficient in using the GitHub tool for version control and collaboration.

The project involved brainstorming ideas and deciding on a concept that the group would build the website around. The group then created wireframes and a project plan that was shared on GitHub. Each member of the team was assigned specific tasks, and the project was divided into manageable sections that each member could work on.
  

As work progressed, the team met regularly to discuss progress, issues, and next steps. Each member of the group reviewed each other's work to ensure consistency and quality. GitHub was used to merge changes, track issues, and to keep everyone updated with progress.

The website that was created was both functional and visually appealing, showcasing the team's newfound knowledge of web development technologies and their ability to work collaboratively using GitHub. The group project was a valuable learning experience that taught the team how to work as a cohesive unit while navigating the complexities of version control and collaboration.</p>
