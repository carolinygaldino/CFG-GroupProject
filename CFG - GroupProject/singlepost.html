            <h1>Planning for wellness.</h1>
            <span>By Admin on August 2022</span>
            <h2>1. Take inventory of your life.</h2>
            <p>
              Write down the eight dimensions and put your life under a
              microscope. Where are you excelling? What activities are already
              in place that you want to continue? Now move into the areas you
              would like to improve. Are you working too much? Do you find the
              number of your meaningful relationships dwindling? More generally,
              where are you currently unhappy –– and what do you think is lying
              at the root of that unhappiness? Now give each of the eight
              dimensions a 1-10 ranking. 1 being the poorest rank, 10 being the
              best. This should give you a quick bird’s-eye view of the areas
              that need the most improvement.
            </p>
            <h2>2. Set S.M.A.R.T. goals.</h2>
            <p>
              Any goal should be specific, measurable, achievable, realistic,
              and timely. By creating parameters around your goals and making
              sure each is attainable, you’ll have a better chance at meeting
              them. Begin with your larger goals and then set smaller,
              short-term goals that ladder back to your big ones. As you plan
              and begin to execute on your goals, it’s important to remember how
              critical patience is. You’re beginning a journey. There will be
              bumps in the road and twists and turns along the way. This is what
              comes with personal evolution. Don’t let it discourage or derail
              your plans.
            </p>
            <h2>3. Track your progress.</h2>
            <p>
              Once you’ve taken inventory and set some goals, the real work
              begins. That’s why you need a plan and routines that help you
              track your progress. There are numerous ways you can do this. Find
              a spouse, significant other, or friend who can serve as an
              accountability partner. That’s one way. Personal weekly check-ins
              are another idea that we love. Find a day and time of the week
              where you have the mental clarity and emotional space to think.
              Then break out your plan and reflect on how you’re doing. Where
              are you excelling and where are you falling short? Maybe your
              personal check-ins come in the form of a daily journal entry where
              you report your progress back to yourself. You can do this on
              paper and with a pen or on your computer. The key is to make sure
              you’re tracking. Don’t forget, a step backwards doesn’t mean
              you’ve failed. It actually means you’re making progress. So keep
              at it.
            </p>
            <h2>4. Update your wellness plans regularly.</h2>
            <p>
              Pure wellness is always evolving. Unfortunately, there is no
              endpoint where you can just coast and call it good. But that’s the
              amazing, wonderful thing about the journey. The more we change and
              grow, the more opportunities for growth we uncover. Sometimes our
              old goals give way to new goals. And sometimes we realize that our
              goals take more time than we originally anticipated. That’s ok. In
              fact, it’s great. This is what makes being a human so wonderful.
              We recommend updating your wellness plan regularly. Maybe this
              happens once a month or twice a year. Which goals and ideas are
              still working for you? Which do you want to adjust? Are there any
              you’d like to replace? Your personal wellness plan is a WIP – just
              like each one of our lives is. Wellness isn’t purchased. It’s not
              an idea or a gym membership. It’s baked into every corner of our
              lives. Achieving long-lasting health and happiness starts with a
              plan that sets you on the right course –– and one you’ll actually
              stick to and achieve. Will there be bumps and blindspots and
              setbacks along the way? You bet. But will there be more moments
              full of wonder, amazement, and happiness? Absolutely. So get out
              there and make your plan.
