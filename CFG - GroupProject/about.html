            <h1>What is wellness?</h1>
            <p>
              Wellness is the act of practicing healthy habits on a daily basis
              to attain better physical and mental health outcomes, so that
              instead of just surviving, you’re thriving.”
            </p>
            <p>
              To understand the significance of wellness, it’s important to
              understand how it's linked to health. According to the World
              Health Organization (WHO), health is defined as being “a state of
              complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the
              absence of disease or infirmity
            </p>
            <hr />

            <h1>How does wellness looks?</h1>
            <p>
              Wellness encompasses 8 mutually interdependent dimensions:
              physical, intellectual, emotional, social, spiritual, vocational,
              financial, and environmental
            </p>
            <p>
              Attention must be given to all the dimensions, as neglect of any
              one over time will adversely affect the others, and ultimately
              one’s health, well-being, and quality of life. They do not,
              however, have to be equally balanced. We should aim, instead, to
              strive for a “personal harmony” that feels most authentic to us.
              We naturally have our own priorities, approaches, and aspirations,
              including our own views of what it means to live life fully.
