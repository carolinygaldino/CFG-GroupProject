                  <p>
                    Write down the eight dimensions and put your life under a
                    microscope. Where are you excelling? What activities are
                    already in place that you want to continue? Now move into
                    the areas you would like to improve. Are you working too
                    much? Do you find the number of your meaningful
                    relationships dwindling? More generally, where are you
                    currently unhappy –– and what do you think is lying at the
                    root of that unhappiness? .

                  <h1>Set S.M.A.R.T. goals.</h1>
                  <p>
                    Any goal should be specific, measurable, achievable,
                    realistic, and timely. By creating parameters around your
                    goals and making sure each is attainable, you’ll have a
                    better chance at meeting them. Begin with your larger goals
                    and then set smaller, short-term goals that ladder back to
                    your big ones. As you plan and begin to execute on your
                    goals, it’s important to remember how critical patience is.
                    You’re beginning a journey. There will be bumps in the road
                    and twists and turns along the way. This is what comes with
                    personal evolution. Don’t let it discourage or derail your
                    plans.

                  <p>
                    Once you’ve taken inventory and set some goals, the real
                    work begins. That’s why you need a plan and routines that
                    help you track your progress. There are numerous ways you
                    can do this. Find a spouse, significant other, or friend who
                    can serve as an accountability partner.

                    Pure wellness is always evolving. Unfortunately, there is no
                    endpoint where you can just coast and call it good. But
                    that’s the amazing, wonderful thing about the journey. The
                    more we change and grow, the more opportunities for growth
                    we uncover. Sometimes our old goals give way to new goals.
                    And sometimes we realize that our goals take more time than
                    we originally anticipated. That’s ok.
